# Spotify Dashboard - Power BI Project

## Overview

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard built on a Spotify dataset. The dashboard visualizes key metrics and trends from Spotify data, providing insights into user behavior, listening patterns, and song popularity. It aims to give a comprehensive analysis of Spotify usage, enabling better understanding and decision-making.

## Features

- **Spotify User Insights**: Track user activity and engagement with Spotify features.
- **Top Tracks and Artists**: View the most popular tracks and artists over different time periods.
- **Listening Habits**: Analyze listening behavior, including genres, time spent, and playlist engagement.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Interact with different filters to visualize the data based on various criteria (e.g., time range, genre, region).
- **Custom Visualizations**: A range of custom visuals and graphs for data representation, including bar charts, line charts, pie charts, etc.

## Data Sources
